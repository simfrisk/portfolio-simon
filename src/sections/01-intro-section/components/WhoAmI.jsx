      <h3>Frontend Developer</h3>
      <p>I’m a web developer drawn to creativity and problem-solving. I started out in the film industry, so I see things a bit differently. I’m always looking for cleaner, more efficient ways to do things and just make the work better overall. I’m a curious person by nature, and when something grabs my attention, I tend to go all in. I’m all about improving and leveling up over time, not just checking boxes. Challenges? Honestly, they just make things more fun.</p>
